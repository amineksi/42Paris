# 42ParisJuly2024

## Introduction 
Welcome to my learning repository! During this month, I went through the whole 42 Piscine. This README will serve as a guide to my learning process, goals, and outcomes.

## Structure
- Each day is represented by a folder named cXX (e.g., c00, c01, etc.).
- Inside each day's folder:
  - `exXX/`: Contains the code written for each exercise.
  - `README.md`: Provides a detailed summary of tasks completed, concepts learned, challenges faced, and reflections.
## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to:
- Track my progress throughout the 42 Piscine program.
- Document the skills and knowledge acquired daily.
- Serve as a resource for others interested in the 42 Piscine experience.
- 
## Navigation
- Explore each day's folder to view specific code and detailed summaries.
- Feel free to leave comments, suggestions, or questions on any day's README.md file.

Enjoy exploring my 42 Piscine journey!
