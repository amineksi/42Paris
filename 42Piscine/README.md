# 42Piscine

Welcome to the 42Piscine repository ! It contains each project I've completed during the Piscine, which is an intensive programming bootcamp made to teach the fundamentals of coding and problem-solving, using the principles of peer learning.

## Structure

1. **BSQ (Algorithm)**
2. **C (13.5/14)**
3. **Rush (66%)**
4. **Shell (100%)**

Here's an overview of each folder and it's contents.

### BSQ (Algorithm)

The [BSQ](./BSQ) folder contains the implementation of the "Biggest Square" algorithm, which in a map, creates the biggest square of empty spaces avoiding the obstacles.

### C

The [C](./Days) folder includes the C programming projects done during the Piscine. (100% completed except for C10 which's half-done)

### Rush

The [Rush](./Rush) folder contains group projects which are done under 2 days and require quick thinking. (First two are fully completed)

### Shell

The [Shell](./Shell) folder contains the shell scripting projects.
