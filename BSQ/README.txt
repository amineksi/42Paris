# HOW TO EXECUTE

# Write "make" in your terminal in order to create the program.

# You can run it with your own maps or with a map generator.

# Generate your maps using "perl gen.sh x y density > <filename>"

# We capped the map at 1023*1023

# After your maps are created, run "./bsq <filename>". (as many files as you want)

# If you want to enter your map directly through the terminal enter this :

# echo "<your map>" | .bsq
